# Handle variables that are being *modified* (as opposed to just set to a fixed
# value) by adding something in the front. After we modify them, we set
# a sentinel variable to avoid doing this again in child shells.
#
# Details:
# Assume 'PATH=a:b:c:$PATH' being present in a file that's read for both
# interactive and non-interactive shell startup. If you launch a child shell
# (say, from vim), PATH would end up with duplicates. If you modify $PATH during your shell runtime (for example via virtualenvwrapper), you end up with:
#
# $ PATH=venv_bin:$PATH
# $ vim
# :!echo $PATH
# a:b:c:venv_bin:a:b:c:...
#
# zsh's 'typeset -U' helps a bit with this situation - instead of adding
# duplicated elements, zsh is moving them to the front instead. Which helps for
# PATH elongation problem as long as you don't run into scenario described
# above.
#
# :!echo $PATH
# a:b:c:venv_bin:...
#
# Grrr.
